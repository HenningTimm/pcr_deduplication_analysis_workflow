      subcommands:
        - fastq:
            about: |
              Tool to remove PCR duplicates from UMI-tagged reads.

              Takes two FASTQ files (forward and reverse) and returns two FASTQ files in which all PCR duplicates have been merged into a consensus read.
              Duplicates are identified by a Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI).

              Assumptions:
                - Reads are of equal length
                - UMI is the prefix of the reads

              Example:
              rbt call-consensus-reads \
                reads_1.fq reads_2.fq \    # input files
                merged_1.fq merged_2.fq \  # output files
                -l 13 \                    # length of UMI
                -d 1 \                     # max hamming distance of UMIs within a cluster
                -D 2 \                     # max hamming distance of sequences within a cluster
                --umi-on-reverse           # UMI is the prefix of the reverse read
              {n}
